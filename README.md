# UncertaintyManagementPowerSystemsOperations

In this package, we will develop uncertainty quantificaiton and management methods for power system operations with grid-edging resources. This package can be applied for (1) electric vehicle charging management, (2) hybrid AC/DC microgrid energy management, (3) distribution system management, (4) transmission system management, (5) all electric ships, (6) data centers.

The general steps are listed as follows:

-Customized data input

-Problem formulation
* Uncertainty quantification
1. Probabilistic analysis with discrete support
2. Robust uncertainty set
3. Distributionally robust ambiguity set

* Decision making problem formulation
1. Two/Multi-stage Stochastic optimization
2. Two-stage robust optimization
3. Two-stage distributionally robust optimization

-Solution algorithm
1. Benders decomposition
2. Column generation
3. Nested column generation
4. Lagrange decomposition
5. Hybrid decomposition

-Call solvers
1. Gurobi
2. CPLEX
3. COPT
4. MOSEK

This package is under development and lots of functions will be updated recently. If you want to jion us on this journey, please send e-mail to matrixeigs@gmail.com.
